# Segment-Based Numeric Neural Network Classifier

A machine learning project that implements and experiments with segment-based numeric neural network classification. The repository contains code and notebooks for building, training, and evaluating classifiers on numeric data, with an emphasis on model architecture and interpretability.

## Overview

This project explores the application of neural networks for classifying numeric data by leveraging segment-based features. The work includes data preprocessing, neural network design, model evaluation, and visualization of results. The primary goal is to understand how segment-based approaches can improve numeric classification tasks.

## Skills Learned

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling and preparing numeric datasets for neural network training.
- **Neural Network Design:** Building models in Python using libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive experimentation, data analysis, and result visualization.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Implementing training loops, loss functions, and performance metrics.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating and analyzing segment-based features for numeric data.
- **Visualization:** Plotting training metrics, confusion matrices, and feature importances to interpret model performance.
- **Reproducibility:** Using notebooks and Python scripts to ensure experiments can be replicated.

## Repository Structure

- `*.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks containing data exploration, model implementation, and experiment results.
- `*.py`: Python scripts for core logic, utility functions, and model definitions.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions (this file).
- `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`: (If present) Lists required dependencies.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Recommended: Create a virtual environment

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cupcakequeen77777/Segment-Based-Numeric-Neural-Network-Classifier.git
   cd Segment-Based-Numeric-Neural-Network-Classifier
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   If you have a requirements file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or manually install core packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow jupyter
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Open the desired `.ipynb` notebook** and follow the cells in order. Notebooks include explanations, code, and results.

### Running Python Scripts

If you prefer running scripts directly:
```bash
python your_script.py
```
Replace `your_script.py` with the desired script filename.

## Results

- Trained model performance metrics (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, etc.) are displayed in the notebooks.
- Visualizations provide insight into model learning and feature importance.
